# Backend Connector & Database 🔗💾

This folder contains scripts to connect the frontend with the backend API for the Tarass project, as well as a small database used by the backend.

---

## ⚡ Note
The full backend connector folder (including database) is available as a compressed file due to its size.  
You can download it here:  
[Download Backend Connector ZIP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o4H_AkweVFrWcHngQP1TdK872CTHaM0J?usp=drive_link)

## 🚀 Getting Started
After downloading and extracting the ZIP:

1. Ensure that the ML API is running (`ml_api/app.py`).
2. The backend will automatically connect to the included database (`tarass.db`).
3. Use the connector scripts to interact with the API. For example:
    ```python
    from backend_connector.connector import call_api
    response = call_api(data)
    ```
4. Inspect the database if needed using any SQLite client:
    ```bash
    sqlite3 tarass.db
    ```
